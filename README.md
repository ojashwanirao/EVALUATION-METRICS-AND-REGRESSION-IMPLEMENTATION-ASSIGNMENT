📊 Regression and Evaluation Metrics – Practical ML Assignments
This repository contains 25 Python-based practical assignments focused on regression models, evaluation metrics, and machine learning pipelines. The tasks are designed to help learners apply core concepts of Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Error Metrics, Model Serialization, and Pipeline Creation using libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and joblib.
